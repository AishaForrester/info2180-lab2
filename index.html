                <p>Life is a canvas left to our imagination. Sometimes we feel the need to peer on 
                    the painting of our neighbour. Admittedly, sometimes their art may seem more unique
                    and even more captivating than our own. Sometimes we feel that our art is one
                    that is meant to be scrutinized and thrown back into our faces if they do not fit a 
                    certain societal construct. We force ourselves into believing that we must be the 
                    best. But what makes a better artist? Is it not the same unrefined authenticity
                    that we rob ourselves of? </p>
                <p>Sometimes we need to take a step back and make use of the resources that were
                    designed to create our very own masterpiece. We must motivate ourselves to believe
                    that we contain all that is necessary to succeed.

                <h2 class="title2">The Importance of education</h2>
                <h3 class="dateAuth2">October 1, 2023 by Aisha Forrester </h3>
                <img src="img/books.jpg" alt="A canvas" class="ima2">
                <p>School plays a fundamental role in shaping the future of individuals and society as a 
                   whole. It serves as the cornerstone of education, equipping students with knowledge, 
                   skills, and critical thinking abilities that are essential for personal growth and 
                   success in the ever-evolving world. In the classroom, students not only gain subject-
                   specific knowledge but also cultivate essential life skills such as communication, 
                   problem-solving, and teamwork. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, schools play a vital role in promoting equality and inclusivity in society.
                   They provide an opportunity for individuals from diverse backgrounds to access education and 
                   create a level playing field.</p>
